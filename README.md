# The Swift Summary Book
A summary of Apple's Swift language written on Playgrounds.


taak toto je paradicka


###Why this summary?
Apple's documentation is great for learning Swift, but who's got the time to read all that? :smile:

This summary cuts to the chase. It is directly written on the Playgrounds platform, which makes it very interactive.
You can tinker around with it as much as you like!


####Keep in mind:exclamation:
The Swift language is still under rapid development, which means that the documentation is changing all the time.
This summary is up to date with Swift v2.2. This means that, as the language is updated, some sections in the summary might break.


####You can help too!
Help me keep this summary :+1: with the latest versions of Swift!
